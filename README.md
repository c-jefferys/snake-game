# snake-game
My personal recreation of the classic Snake game using Pygame. Handles Pygame events and has an active score counter. Allows user to either quit or start a new game upon game over.

## Execution
Make sure the snake.py file is in a python environment with Pygame installed (pip install pygame). Then just run and enjoy the game!
